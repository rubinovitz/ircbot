 we accept the love we think we deserve.  
 So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.  
 And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.  
 Things change. And friends leave. Life doesn't stop for anybody.  
 So, I guess we are who we are for alot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.  
 I would die for you. But I won't live for you.  
 There's nothing like deep breaths after laughing that hard. Nothing in the world like a sore stomach for the right reasons.  
 I think that if I ever have kids, and they are upset, I won't tell them that people are starving in China or anything like that because it wouldn't change the fact that they were upset. And even if somebody else has it much worse, that doesn't really change the fact that you have what you have. , The Perks Of Being A Wallflower 
 I am very interested and fascinated how everyone loves each other, but no one really likes each other.  
 Once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines he wrote a poemAnd he called it "Chops" because that was the name of his dogAnd that's what it was all aboutAnd his teacher gave him an A and a gold starAnd his mother hung it on the kitchen door and read it to his auntsThat was the year Father Tracy took all the kids to the zooAnd he let them sing on the busAnd his little sister was born with tiny toenails and no hairAnd his mother and father kissed a lotAnd the girl around the corner sent him aValentine signed with a row of X's and he had to ask his father what the X's meantAnd his father always tucked him in bed at nightAnd was always there to do itOnce on a piece of white paper with blue lines he wrote a poemAnd he called it "Autumn" because that was the name of the seasonAnd that's what it was all aboutAnd his teacher gave him an A and asked him to write more clearlyAnd his mother never hung it on the kitchen door because of its new paintAnd the kids told him that Father Tracy smoked cigarsAnd left butts on the pewsAnd sometimes they would burn holesThat was the year his sister got glasses with thick lenses and black framesAnd the girl around the corner laughed when he asked her to go see Santa ClausAnd the kids told him why his mother and father kissed a lotAnd his father never tucked him in bed at nightAnd his father got mad when he cried for him to do it.Once on a paper torn from his notebook he wrote a poemAnd he called it "Innocence: A Question" because that was the question about his girlAnd that's what it was all aboutAnd his professor gave him an A and a strange steady lookAnd his mother never hung it on the kitchen door because he never showed herThat was the year that Father Tracy diedAnd he forgot how the end of the Apostle's Creed wentAnd he caught his sister making out on the back porchAnd his mother and father never kissed or even talkedAnd the girl around the corner wore too much makeupThat made him cough when he kissed her but he kissed her anyway because that was the thing to doAnd at three a.m. he tucked himself into bed his father snoring soundlyThat's why on the back of a brown paper bag he tried another poemAnd he called it "Absolutely Nothing"Because that's what it was really all aboutAnd he gave himself an A and a slash on each damned wristAnd he hung it on the bathroom door because this time he didn't think he could reach the kitchen.  
 It's just that I don't want to be somebody's crush. If somebody likes me, I want them to like the real me, not what they think I am. And I don't want them to carry it around inside. I want them to show me, so I can feel it too.  
 I donât know if youâve ever felt like that. That you wanted to sleep for a thousand years. Or just not exist. Or just not be aware that you do exist. Or something like that. I think wanting that is very morbid, but I want it when I get like this. Thatâs why Iâm trying not to think. I just want it all to stop spinning.  
 Enjoy it. Because it's happening.  
 She wasn't bitter. She was sad, though. But it was a hopeful kind of sad. The kind of sad that just takes time.   
 This moment will just be another story someday.  
 And I thought about how many people have loved those songs. And how many people got through a lot of bad times because of those songs. And how many people enjoyed good times with those songs. And how much those songs really mean. I think it would be great to have written one of those songs. I bet if I wrote one of them, I would be very proud. I hope the people who wrote those songs are happy. I hope they feel it's enough. I really do because they've made me happy. And I'm only one person.  
 It's strange because sometimes, I read a book, and I think I am the people in the book.  
 We didn't talk about anything heavy or light. We were just there together. And that was enough  
 And I guess I realized at that moment that I really did love her. Because there was nothing to gain, and that didn't matter.  
 And all the books you've read have been read by other people. And all the songs you've loved have been heard by other people. And that girl that's pretty to you is pretty to other people. and that if you looked at these facts when you were happy, you would feel great because you are describing 'unity.  
 He's a wallflower. You see things. You keep quiet about them. And you understand.  
 please believe that things are good with me, and even when they're not, they will be soon enough. And i will always believe the same about you.  
 I walk around the school hallways and look at the people. I look at the teachers and wonder why they're here. If they like their jobs. Or us. And I wonder how smart they were when they were fifteen. Not in a mean way. In a curious way. It's like looking at all the students and wondering who's had their heart broken that day, and how they are able to cope with having three quizzes and a book report due on top of that. Or wondering who did the heart breaking. And wondering why.  
 It's much easier to not know things sometimes. Things change and friends leave. And life doesn't stop for anybody. I wanted to laugh. Or maybe get mad. Or maybe shrug at how strange everybody was, especially me. I think the idea is that every person has to live for his or her own life and than make the choice to share it with other people. You can't just sit their and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. You just can't. You have to do things. I'm going to do what I want to do. I'm going to be who I really am. And I'm going to figure out what that is. And we could all sit around and wonder and feel bad about each other and blame a lot of people for what they did or didn't do or what they didn't know. I don't know. I guess there could always be someone to blame. It's just different. Maybe it's good to put things in perspective, but sometimes, I think that the only perspective is to really be there. Because it's okay to feel things. I was really there. And that was enough to make me feel infinite. I feel infinite.  
 It was the kind of kiss that mademe know that I was never so happy in my whole life.  
 Just tell me how to be different in a way that makes sense.  
 I just need to know that someone out there listens and understands and doesn't try to sleep with someone even if they could have. I need to know these people exist.  
 I am both happy and sad at the same time, and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.  
 Sometimes people use thought to not participate in life.  
 I walked over to the hill where we used to go and sled. There were a lot of little kids there. I watched them flying. Doing jumps and having races. And I thought that all those little kids are going to grow up someday. And all of those little kids are going to do the things that we do. And they will all kiss someone someday. But for now, sledding is enough. I think it would be great if sledding were always enough, but it isn't.  
 I just want you to know that youâre very specialâ¦ and the only reason Iâm telling you is that I donât know if anyone else ever has.  
 Downtown. Lights on buildings and everything that makes you wonder. And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.  
 Standing on the fringes of life... offers a unique perspective. But there comes a time to see what it looks like from the dance floor.  
 ... Try to be a filter, not a sponge.  
 If somebody likes me, I want them to like the real me, not what they think I am. And I don't want them to carry it around inside. I want them to show me, so I can feel it, too. I want them to be able to do whatever they want around me.  
 Maybe itâs sad that these are now memories. And maybe itâs not sad.

 And even if somebody else has it much worse, that doesn't really change the fact that you have what you have. Good and bad.  
 I think the idea is that every person has to live for his or her own life and then make the choice to share it with other people. Maybe that is what makes people "participate.  
 I wanted to laugh. Or maybe get mad. Or maybe shrug at how strange everyone was, especially me.  
 It's just hard to see a friend hurt this much. Especially when you can't do anything except 'be there.' I just want to make him stop hurting, but I can't. So I just follow him around whenever he wants to show me his world.  
 I have decided that maybe I want to write when I grow up. I just don't know what I would write.  
 You can't just sit there and put everyone's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. You just can't. You have to do things.  
 I don't even remember the season. I just remember walking between them and feeling for the first time that I belonged somewhere.  
 The inside jokes weren't jokes anymore. They had become stories. Nobody brought up the bad names or the bad times. And nobody felt sad as long as we could postpone tomorrow with more nostalgia.   
 Sam and Patrick looked at me. And I looked at them. And I think they knew. Not anything specific really. They just knew. And I think that's all you can ever ask from a friend.  
 I just hope I remember to tell my kids that they are as happy as I look in my old photographs. And I hope that they believe me.  
 Itâs much easier not to know things sometimes.  
 I just don't want you to worry about me, or think you've met me, or waste your time anymore.  
 there is this one photograph... that is just beautiful. it would be impossible to describe how beautiful it is, but iâll try. if you listen to the song âasleep,â and you think about those pretty weather days that make you remember things, and you think about the prettiest eyes youâve known, and you cry and the person holds you back, then i think you will see the photograph.   
 Not everyone has a sob story, Charlie, and even if they do, it's no excuse.  
 What about when someone doesn't need a shoulder? What if they need the arms?  
 And I thought that all those little kids are going to grow up someday. And all of those little kids are going to do the things that we do. And they will all kiss someone someday. But for now, sledding is enough. I think it would be great if sledding were always enough, but it isn't.  
 I don't know how much longer I can keep going without a friend. I used to be able to do it very easily, but that was before I knew what having a friend was like.  
 Patrick actually used to be popular before Sam bought him some good music.  
 And I closed my eyes because I wanted to know nothing but her arms.  
 Itâs like when youâre excited about a girl and you see a couple holding hands, and you feel so happy for them. And other times you see the same couple, and they make you so mad. And all you want is to feel happy for them because you know that if you do, then it means youâre happy, too.  
 Heâs my whole world.ââDonât ever say that about anyone again. Not even me.  
 It's strange to describe reading a book as a really great experience, but that's kind of how it felt.  
 I hate you."I love you."You're a freak, you know that? Everyone says so. They always have."I'm trying not to be.  
 It's like he would take a photograph of Sam, and the photographwould be beautiful. And he would think that the reason thephotograph was beautiful was because of how he took it. If I tookit, I would know that the only reason it's beautiful is because ofSam.  
 Iâm so sorry that I wasted your time because you really do mean a lot to me and I hope you have a very nice life because I really think you deserve it. I really do. I hope you do, too. Okay, then. Goodbye.  
 I don't want to be somebody's crush. If somebody likes me, I want them to like the real me, not what they think I am.  
 I think it was the first time in my life I ever felt like I looked âgoodâ. Do you know what I mean? That nice feeling when you look in the mirror, and your hairâs right for the first time in your life? I donât think we should base so much on weight, muscles, and a good hair day, but when it happens, itâs nice. It really is.  
 Everyone else is either asleep or having sex. I've been watching cable television and eating jello.  
 Sometimes, I look outside, and I think that a lot of other people have seen this snow before. Just like I think that a lot of other people have read those books before. And listened to those songs.I wonder how they feel tonight.  
 I was looking at the photographs and I started thinking that there was a time when these weren't memories.  
 Just tell me how to be different in a way that makes sense. To make this all go away. And disappear. I know that's wrong, because it's my responsibilty, and I know things have to get worse before they get better. I walk around the school hallways and look at the people. I look at the teachers and wonder why their here. If they like their jobs. Or us. I wonder how smart they were when they were fifteen. Not in a mean way. In a curious way. It's like looking at all the students and wondering who's had their heart broken that day. And how they cope with having three quizes and a book report. On top of that. Or wondering who did the heart breaking. And wondering why. Especially since I know that if they went to another school, the person who had their heart broken would have had their heart broken by somebody else, so why does it have to be personal? It's much easier to not know things sometimes. Things change and friends leave. And life doesn't stop for anybody. I wanted to laugh. Or maybe get mad. Or maybe shrug at how strange everybody was, especiall me. I think the idea is that every person has to live for his or her own life and than make the choice to share it with other people. You can't just sit their and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. You just can't. You have to do things. I'm going to do what I want to do. I'm going to be who I really am. And I'm going to figure out what that is. And we could all sit around and wonder and feel bad about each other and blame a lot of people for what they did or didn't do or what they didn't know. I don't know. I guess there could always be someone to blame. It's just different. Maybe it's good to put things in perspective, but sometimes, I think that the only perspective is to really be there. Because it's okay to feel things. I was really there. And that was enough to make me feel infinite. I feel infinite.  
 ...people who try to control situations all the time are afraid that if they don't, nothing will work out the way they want.  
 Something really is wrong with me. And I don't know what it is.  
 It's great that you can listen and be a shoulder to someone, but what about when someone doesn't need a shoulder? What if they need the arms or something like that? You can't just sit there and put everybody's lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. You just can't. You have to do things.  
 It's kind of like when you look at yourself in the mirror and you say your name. And it gets to a point where none of it seems real. Well, sometimes I can do that, but I don't need an hour in front of a mirror. It just happens very fast, and things start to slip away. And I just open my eyes, and I see nothing. And then I start to breathe really hard trying to see something, but I can't. It doesn't happen all the time, but when it does, it scares me.  
 If you care about somebody, you should want them to be happy. Even if you wind up being left out.  
 Have you ever done that? You feel really bad, and then it goes away, and you donât know why.  
 I really think that everyone should have watercolors, magnetic poetry, and a harmonica.  
 You know . . . a lot of kids at school hate their parents. Some of them got hit. And some of them got caught in the middle of wrong lives. Some of them were trophies for their parents to show the neighbors like ribbons or gold stars. And some of them just wanted to drink in peace.  
 Personally, I like to think my brother is having a college experience like they do in the movies. I don't mean the big fraternity party kind of movie. More like the movie where the guy meets a smart girl who wears a lot of sweaters and drinks cocoa. They talk about books and issues and kiss in the rain. I think something like that would be very good for him, especially if the girl were unconventionally beautiful. They are the best kind of girls, I think. I personally find 'super models' strange. I don't know why this is.  
 You take girls, for example. They're copying their moms and magazines and everything to know how to act around guys. I mean it's not like in movies where girls like assholes or anything like that. It's not that easy. They just like somebody that can give them purpose.  
 As much as I feel sad, I think that not knowing is what really bothers me.  
 What's your favorite book? "The last one I read.  
 The thing is, some girls think they can actually change guys. And whatâs funny is that if they actually did change them, theyâd get bored. Theyâd have no challenge left. You just have to give girls some time to think of a new way of doing things, thatâs all. Some of them will figure it out here. Some later. Some never. I wouldnât worry about it too much.  
 Then, I turned around and walked to my room and closed my door and put my head under my pillow and let the quiet put things where they are supposed to be.  
 On Friday night, I was reading my new book, but my brain got tired, so I decided to watch some television instead.  
 I have finished To Kill a Mockingbird. It is now my favorite book of all time, but then again, I always think that until I read another book.  
 It's like when my doctor told me the story of these two brothers whose dad was a bad alcoholic. One brother grew up to be a successful carpenter and never drank. The other brother ended up being a drinker as bad as his dad was. When they asked the first brother why he didn't drink, he said that after he saw what it did to his father, he could never bring himself to even try it. When they asked the other brother, he said that he guessed he learned how to drink on his father's knee. So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.  
 I was in my bed trying to figure out why sometimes you can wake up and go back to sleep and other times you can't  
 But right now Iâm here with you. And I want to know where you are, what you need, and what you want to do.  
 I can't think again. Not ever again. I don't know if you've ever felt like that. That you wanted to sleep for a thousand years. Or just not exist. Or just not be aware that you do exist. Or something like that.  
 I sat down and tried to write a story."Ian MacArthur is a wonderful sweet fellow who wears glasses and peers out of them with delight."That was the first sentence. The problem was that I just couldn't think of the next one. After cleaning my room three times, I decided to leave Ian alone for a while because I was starting to get mad at him.  
 Itâs strange how things can change back as suddenly as they changed originally. When one thing happens and suddenly, things are back to normal.  
 And when she started becoming a âyoung lady,â and no one was allowed to look at her because she thought she was fat. And how she really wasnât fat. And how she was actually very pretty. And how different her face looked when she realized boys thought she was pretty. And how different her face looked the first time she really liked a boy who was not on a poster on her wall. And how her face looked when she realized she was in love with that boy. I wondered how her face would look when she came out from behind those doors.  
 I don't know if it's better to be close with your daughter or make sure that she has a better life than you do.  
 If it meant that I would never get to think of you that way, as long as you were happy, it was okay.  
 Old pictures look very rugged and young, and the people in the photographs always seem a lot happier than you are.  
 Maybe these are my glory days, and I'm not ever realizing it because they involve a ball.  
 Nobody felt sad as long as we could postpone tomorrow with more nostalgia.  
 Girls are weird, and I don't mean that offensively. I just can't put it any other way.  
 But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things.  
 To tell you the truth, I've just been avoiding everything.  
 Do you always think this much, Charlie?" "Is that bad?" "Not necessarily. It's just that sometimes people use thought to not participate in life." "Is that bad?" "Yes.  
 And I wonder if anyone is really happy. I hope they are. I really hope they are.  
 As you enter the tunnel, the wind gets sucked away, and you squint from the lights overhead. When you adjust the lights, you can see the other side in the distance just as the sound of the radio fades to nothing because the waves just canât reach. Then, youâre in the middle of the tunnel, and everything becomes a calm dream. As you see the opening get closer, you just canât get there fast enough. And finally, just when you think youâll never get there, you see the opening right in front of you. And the radio comes back even louder than you remember it. And the wind is waiting. And you fly out of the tunnel onto the bridge. And there it is. The city. A million lights and buildings and everything seems as exciting as the first time you saw it.  
 Patrick started running after the sunset. And Sam immediately followed him. And I saw them in silhouette. Running after the sun.  
 I just wish that God or my parents or Sam or my sister or someone would just tell me what's wrong with me. Just tell me how to be different in a way that makes sense. To make this all go away.  
 I remembered this one time that I never told anybody about. The time we were walking. Just the three of us. I was in the middle. I don't remember where we were walking to or where we were walking from. I just remember the season. I just remember walking between them and feeling for the first time that I belonged somewhere  
 I love Twinkies, and the reason I am saying that is because we are all supposed to think of reasons to live.  
 It was the kind of kiss I could never tell my friends about out loud. It was the kind of kiss that made me know I was never so happy in my whole life.  
 So, I looked up, and we were in this giant dome like a glass snowball, and Mark said that the amazing white stars were really only holes in the black glass of the dome, and when you went to heaven, the glass broke away, and there was nothing but a whole sheet of star white, which is brighter than anything but doesn't hurt your eyes. It was vast and open and thinly quiet, and I felt so small.  
 Maybe he didnât really encourage me to do things, but he didnât prevent me from doing them either. But after a while, I didnât do things because I didnât want him to think different about me. But the thing is, I wasnât being honest. So, why would I care whether or not he loved me when he didnât really even know me?  
 Five minutes of a lifetime were truly spent, and we felt young in a good way.  
 So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them.  
 He's a wallflower.  
 I just think it's bad when a boy looks at a girl and thinks that the way he sees her is better than she actually is. And I think it's bad when the most honest way a boy can look at a girl is through a camera.  
 Sam screamed the fun scream, and there it was. Downtown lights on buildings and everything that makes you wonder. Sam sat down and started laughing. Patrick started laughing. I started laughing. and in that moment, I swear we were infinite.  
 Every person has to live his or her own life and then make the choice to share it with other people.  
 I'm just thinking too fast-- much too fast.  
 I just need to know that someone out there listens and understandsâ¦I need to know that these people exist.  
 She took me to her room and stood me in front of her dresser, which was covered in a pillowcase with pretty colors. She lifted off the pillowcase, and there I was, standing in my old suit, looking at an old typewriter with a fresh ribbon. Inside the typewriter was a piece of white paper.On that piece of white paper, Sam wrote, "Write about me sometime." And I typed something back to her, standing right there in her bedroom. I just typed."I will."And I felt good that those were the first two words that I ever typed on my new old typewriter that Sam gave me. We just sat there quiet for a moment, and she smiled. And I moved to the typewriter again, and I wrote something."I love you, too."And Sam looked at the paper, and she looked at me."Charlie . . . have you ever kissed a girl?"I shook my head no. It was so quiet."Not even when you were little?"I shook my head no again. And she looked very sad.She told me about the first time she was kissed. She told me that it was with one of her dad's friends. She was seven. And she told nobody about it except for Mary Elizabeth and then Patrick a year ago. And she started to cry. And she said something that I won't forget. Ever."I know that you know that I like Craig. And I know that I told you not to think of me that way. And I know that we can't be together like that. But I want to forget all those things for a minute. Okay?""Okay.""I want to make sure that the first person you kiss loves you. Okay?"Okay." She was crying harder now. And I was, too, because when I hear something like that I just can't help it."I just want to make sure of that. Okay?""Okay."And she kissed me. It was the kind of kiss that I could never tell my friends about out loud. It was the kind of kiss that made me know that I was never so happy in my whole life.  
 I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.  
 As I was walking up the stairs to dad's old room, and I was looking at the photographs, I started thinking that there was a time when these weren't memories. That someone actually took the photograph, and the people in the photograph had just eaten lunch or something.  
 I feel like a big faker because I've been putting my life back together, and nobody knows.  
 [I] put my head under my pillow and let the quiet put things where they are supposed to be.  
 So, tomorrow, Iâm leaving. And Iâm not going to let that happen again with anyone else. Iâm going to do what I want to do. Iâm going to be who I really am. And Iâm going to figure out what that is.  
 Lights on buildings and everything that makes you wonder.  
 And we could all sit around and wonder and feel bad about each other and blame a lot of people for what they did or didnât do or what they didnât know. I donât know. I guess there would always be someone to blame.  
 Maybe it's good to put things in perspective, but sometimes, I think that the only perspective is to really be there.  
 I want to make sure that the first person you kiss loves you, okay?  
 It's strange the times people choose to be generous.  
 I feel infinite.  
 I donât know if I will have the time to write any more letters, because I might be too busy trying to participate. So, if this does end up being the last letter, I just want you to know that I was in a bad place before I started high school, and you helped me. Even if you didnât know what I was talking about, or know someone whoâs gone through it, you made me not feel alone. Because I know there are people who say all these things donât happen. And there are people who forget what itâs like to be sixteen when they turn seventeen. I know these will all be stories some day, and our pictures will become old photographs. We all become somebodyâs mom or dad. But right now, these moments are not stories. This is happening. I am here, and I am looking at her. And she is so beautiful. I can see it. This one moment when you know youâre not a sad story. You are alive. And you stand up and see the lights on the buildings and everything that makes you wonder. And youâre listening to that song, and that drive with the people who you love most in this world. And in this moment, I swear, we are infinite.  
 Everyone loves each other, but no one really likes each other  
 Even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.  
 When I was driving home, I just thought about the word 'special'. And I thought the last person who said that about me was my Aunt Helen. I was very grateful to have heard it again. Because I guess we all forget sometimes. And I think everyone is special in their own way. I really do.  
 I guess I'm pretty emotional.  
 I donât want to start thinking again. Not like I have this last week. I canât think again. Not ever again.  
 Everyone is special in their own way.  
 Dear friend,I feel great! I really mean it. I have to remember his for the next time I'm having a terrible week. Have you wer done that? You feel really bad, and then it goes away, and you don't know why. I try to remind myself when I feel great like this that there will be another terrible week coming someday, so I should store up as many great details as I can, so during the next terrible week, I can remember those details and believe that I'll feel great again. It doesn't work a lot, but I think it's very important to try.   
 I'm going to do what I want to do. I'm going to be who I really am. And I'm going to figure out what that is.  
 I look at the field, and I think about the boy who just made the touchdown. I think that these are the glory days for that boy, and this moment will just be another story someday because all the people who make touchdowns and home runs will become somebody's dad. And when his children look at his yearbook photograph, they will think that their dad was rugged and handsome and looked a lot happier than they are. I just hope I remember to tell my kids that they are as happy as I look in my old photographs. And I hope that they believe me.  
 I would die for you, but I wonât live for you.  
 I am really in love with Sam, and it hurts very much.  
 Why do I and everyone I love pick people who treat us like we're nothing"; - "We accept the love we think we deserve,  
 Sam has brown hair and very, very pretty green eyes. The kind of green that doesn't make a big deal about itself.   
 I think that if I ever have kids, and they are upset, I wonât tell them that people are starving in China or anything like that because it wouldnât change the fact that they were upset. And even if somebody else has it much worse, that doesnât really change the fact that you have what you have. Good and bad. ..Maybe itâs good to put things in perspective, but sometimes, I think that the only perspective is to really be there. Because itâs okay to feel things. And be who you are about them.  
 I was very grateful to have heard it again. Because I guess we all forget sometimes. And I think everyone is special in their own way. I really do.  
 The fact that one of these ladies was my mom made me particularly sad because my mom is beautiful. And sheâs always on a diet. Sometimes, my dad calls her beautiful, but she cannot hear him.  
 Charlie, youâre one of the most gifted people Iâve ever known. And I donât mean in terms of my other students. I mean in terms of anyone Iâve ever met.  
 And things were back to normal except we were just friends.  
 The movie itself was very interesting, but I didn't think it was very good because I didn't really feel different when it was over.  
 To tell you the truth I love Sam. It's not a movie kind of love either. I just look at her sometimes and I think she is the prettiest and nicest person in the whole world.  
 I'm only being cute here. I don't really mean it. I just wanted to make you smile.  
 I was suddenly very aware of the fact it was me standing up in that tunnel with the wind over my face. Not caring if I saw downtown. Not even thinking about it. Because I was standing in the tunnel. And I was really there. And that was enough to make me feel infinite.  
 just be yourself  
 Sam looked at me soft. And she hugged me. And I closed my eyes because I wanted to know nothing but her arms. And she kissed my cheek and whispered so nobody could hear."I love you.  
 Craig said the problem with things is that everyone is always comparing everyone with everyone  
 I don't know what's wrong with me. It's like all I can do is keep writing this gibberish to keep from breaking apart.  
 â... but my dad said it was no excuse."But I love him!" I had never seen my sister cry that much."No, you don't.""I hate you!""No, you don't." My dad can be very calm sometimes."He's my whole world.""Don't ever say that about anyone again. Not even me." That was my mom.  
 If somebody likes me... I want them to show me, so I can feel it too.  
 Despite everything my mom and doctor and dad have said tome about blame, I can't stop thinking what I know. And I knowthat my aunt Helen would still be alive today if she just bought meone present like everybody else. She would be alive if I were bornon a day that didn't snow.  
 The outside lights were on, and it was snowing, and it looked like magic. Like we were somewhere else. Like we were someplace better.  
 I love my mom. And this time, I told her I loved her. And she told me she loved me, too. And things were okay for a little while.  
 Maybe this are my glory days, and I'm not even realizing it...  
 I didn't know that other people thought things about me. I didn't know that they looked.  
 When to stopped wishing things wouldn't fall apart, you'd stop suffering when they did.  
 Love pats are soft punches of encouragement that are admistered on the knee, shoulder, and arm.  
 I don't know the significance of this, but I find it very interesting.  
 When the police came, they found my brother asleep on the roof. Nobody knows how he got there.   
 I didn't feel like reading that night, so I went downstairs and watched a half-hour long commercial that advertised an exercise machine. They kept flashing a 1-800 number, so I called it. The woman who picked up the other end of the phone was named Michelle. And I told Michelle that I was a kid and did not need an exercise machine, but I hoped she was having a good night.That's when Michelle hung up on me. And I didn't mind a bit.  
 My sister was the one who told me where babies come from. My sister was also the one who laughed when I immediately asked her where babies go to.  
 I really do love my sister. Especially when she's nice.  
 I had an amazing feeling when I finally held the tape in my hand. I just thought to myself that in the palm of my hand, there was this one tape that had all these memories and feelings and great joy and sadness. Right there in the palm of my hand. And I thought about how many people have loved those songs, And how many people got through a lot of bad times because of those songs. And how many people enjoyed good times with those songs. And how much those songs really mean. I think it would be great to have written one of those songs, I bed if I wrote one of them, I would be very proud. I hope the people who wrote those songs are happy. I hope they feel it's enough. I really do because they've made me happy. And I'm only one person.  
 I just think it's bad when a boy looks at a girl and thinks that the way he sees the girl is better than the girl actually is.  
 the juniors were acting different because they are now the seniors. They even had T-shirts made. I don't know who plans these things.  
 But mostly, I was crying because I was suddenly very aware ofthe fact that it was me standing up in that tunnel with the windover my face. Not caring if I saw downtown. Not even thinkingabout it. Because I was standing in the tunnel. And I was reallythere. And that was enough to make me feel infinite.  
 Sam tapped her hand on the steering wheel. Patrick held his hand outside the car and made air waves. I just sat between them. After the song finished, I said something.'I feel infinite.'And Sam and Patrick looked at me like I said the greatest thing they ever heard. Because the song was that great and because we all really paid attention to it. Five minutes of a lifetime were truly spent, and we felt young in a good way. I have since bought the record, and I would tell you what it was, but truthfully, it's not the same unless you're driving to your first real party, and you're sitting in the middle seat of a pickup with two nice people when it starts to rain.  
 ...we are all supposed to think of reasons to live.  
 I wish I could stop being in love with Sam. I really do.  
 They just knew. And I think that's all you can ever ask from a friend.  
 As you see the opening get closer, you just can't get fast enough. And finally, just when you think you'll never get there, you see the opening right in front of you.  
 Charlie, donât you get it? I canât feel that. Itâs sweet and everything, but itâs like youâre not even there sometimes. Itâs great that you can listen and be a shoulder to someone, but what about when someone doesnât need a shoulder? What if they need the arms or something like that? You canât just sit there and put everybodyâs lives ahead of yours and think that counts as love. You just canât. You have to do things.  
 So, I heard you're this ninja or something.  
 I wonder what it will be like when I leave this place.  
 I look at people holdings hands in the hallways, and I try to think how it all works. At the school dances, I sit in the background, and I tap my toe, and I wonder how many couples will dance to âtheir song.â In the hallways, I see the girls wearing the guysâ jackets, and I think about the idea of property. And I wonder if anyone is really happy.  
 And even if she says no, and really means yes, then quite frankly she's playing games and isn't worth the price of dinner.  
 It's nice to have things to look forward to.  
 I don't know if you've ever felt like that. That you wanted to sleep for thousands of years. Or just not exist..  
 Girls like guys to be a challenge. It gives them some mold to fit in how they act. Like a mom. What would a mom do if she couldn't fuss over you and make you clean your room? And what would you do without her fussing and making you do it? Everyone needs a mom. And a mom knowns this. And it gives her a sense of purpose. You get it?  
 And I could see this boy doing his homework and thinking about my sister naked. And I could see them holding hands at football games that they do not watch. And I could see this boy throwing up in the bushes at a party house. And I could see my sister putting up with it. And I felt very bad for both of them.  
 It's much easier to not know things sometimes. Things change and friends leave. And life doesn't stop for anybody.  
 I know that I brought this all on myself. I know that I deserve this. I'd do anything not to be this way. I'd do anything to make it up to everyone. And to not have to see a psychiatrist, who explains to me about being "passive aggressive.  
 So what's the point of using words nobody else knows or can say comfortably? I just don't understand that.  
 Maybe it's good to put things in perspective, but sometimes, I think that the only perspective is to really be there. Like Sam said. Because it's okay to feel things. And be who you are about them.  
 The fights are always the same  
 More like the movie where the guy meets a smart girl who wears a lot of sweaters and drinks cocoa. They talk about books and issues and kiss in the rain.  
 Why would I care whether or not he loved me when he didn't even really know me?  
 Please believe that things are going good with me. Even if they're not they will be soon enough.  
 Ther perfect song on the perfect drive to make you feel infinite.  
 I was in the shopping mall because that's where I go lately. For the last couple of weeks, I've been going there every day, trying to figure out why people go there. It's kind of a personal project.  
 That's when Sam grabbed my hand. "I love this song!" She led me to the dance floor. And she started dancing. And I started dancing. It was a fast song, so I wasn't very good, but she didn't seem to mind. We were just dancing, and that was enough. The song ended, and then a slow one came on. She looked at me. I looked at her. Then, she took my hands and pulled me in to dance slow. I don't know how to dance slow very well either, but I do know how to sway. Her whisper smelled like cranberry juice and vodka. "I looked for you in the parking lot today." I hoped mine still smelled like toothpaste. "I was looking for you, too." Then, we were quiet for the rest of the song. She held me a little closer. I held her a little closer. And we kept dancing. It was the one time all day that I really wanted the clock to stop. And just be there for a long time.  
 I would give someone a record so they could love the record, not so they would always know that I gave it to them.  
 I can see it. This one moment when you know youâre not a sad story. Youâre alive. And you stand up and see the lights and the buildings and everything that makes you wonder. And youâre listening to that song in that drive with the people you love most in this world. And in this moment I swearâ¦ we are infinite.  
 Sometimes, I think Bill forgets that I am sixteen. But I am very happy that he does.  
 They are all my favourites. All of them.  
 I guess what Iâm saying is that this all feels very familiar. But itâs not mine to be familiar about. I just know that another kid has felt this. This one time when itâs peaceful outside, and youâre seeing things move, and you donât want to, and everyone is asleep. And all the books youâve read have been read by other people. And all the songs youâve loved have been heard by other people. And you know that if you looked at these when you were happy, you would feel great because you are describing âunityâ.  
 I must have been in the car for a long time because eventually my sister found me there. I was chain-smoking cigarettes and crying still. My sister knocked on the window. I rolled it down. She looked at me with this curious expression. Then, her curiosity turned to anger."Charlie, are you smoking?!"She was so mad. I can't tell you how mad she was."I can't believe you're smoking!"That's when I stopped crying. And started laughing. Because of all the things she could have said right after she got out of there, she picked my smoking. And she got angry about it. And I knew if my sister was angry, then her face wouldn't be that different. And she would be okay."I'm going to tell Mom and Dad, you know?""No, you're not." God, I couldn't stop laughing.When my sister thought about it for a second, I think she figured out why she wouldn't tell Mom or Dad. It's like she suddenly remembered where we were and what had just happened and how crazy our whole conversation was considering at all. Then, she started laughing.But the laughing made her feel sick, so I had to get out of the car and help her into the backseat. I had already set up the pillow and the blanket for her because we figured it was probably best for her to sleep it off a little in the car before we went home.Just before she feel asleep, she said, "Well, it you're going to smoke, crack the window at least."Which made me start laughing again."Charlie, smoking. I can't believe it."Which made me laugh harder, and I said, "I love you."And my sister said, "I love you too. Just stop it with the laughing already.  
 She said that by introducing me to all these great things, Mary Elizabeth gained a âsuperior positionâ that she wouldnât need if she was confident about herself. She also said that people who try to control situations all the time are afraid that if they donât, nothing will work out the way they want.   
 I'm not saying she was lying to me, but she just acted so different before I got to know her, and if she really isn't like what she was at the beginning, I wish she could have just said so.  
 For me personally, as much as I don't understand my mom and dad and as much as I feel sorry for them sometimes, I can't help but love them very much.  
 I wan Sam to stop liking Craig.Now I guess maybe you think thatâs because I am jealous of him. Iâm not. Honest. Itâs just that Craig doesnât really listen to her when she talks. I donât mean that heâs a bad guy because heâs not. Itâs just that he always looks distracted.Itâs like he would take a photograph of Sam, and the photograph would be beautiful. And he would think the reason the photograph was beautiful was because of how he took it. If I took it, I would know that the only reason itâs beautiful is because of Sam.I just think itâs bad when a boy looks at a girl and thinks that the way he sees the girl is better than the girl actually is. And I think itâs bad when the most honest way a boy can look at a girl is through a camera. Itâs very hard for me to see Sam feel better about herself just because an older boy sees her that way.  
 About half a mile from the tunnel, Sam stopped the car, and I climbed in back. Patrick played the radio really loud so I could hear it, and as we were approaching the tunnel, I listened to the music and tought about all the things that people have said to me over the past year. I thought about Bill telling me I was special. And my sister saying she loved me. And my mom, too. And even my dad and brother when I was in the hospital. I thought about Patrick calling me his friend. And I thought about Sam telling me to do things. To really be there. and I just thought how great it was to have friends and a family.  
 My dad said I did the right thing. I hope I did, but it's hard to tell sometimes.  
 I'm trying not to think about it too much because that makes it worse. It's kind of like when you look at yourself in the mirror and you say your name. And it gets to a point where none of it seems real. I can do that, but I don't need an hour in front of a mirror. It happens very fast, and things start to slip away.  
 All I could do is lie there and think about how much her voice changed when she asked me if she was pretty, and how much she changed when I answered.  
 Welcome to the island of misfit toys  
 Bridget who is crazy said that sometimes she thought about suicide when commercials come on during TV. She was sincere and this puzzled the guidance counselors.  
 no more pencils, no more books, no more teachers' dirty looks, when the teacher rings the bell, drop your books and run like hell  
 It's like looking at all the students and wondering who's had their heart broken that day, and how they are able to cope with having three quizzes and a book report on top of that.  
 I think the idea is that every person has to live for his or her own life and then make the choice to share it with other people.  
 ...calls her beautiful, but she cannot hear...  
 ...there was a time when these weren't memories.  
 ...the problem with things is that everyone is always comparing everyone with everyone and because of that, it discredits people...  
 But at one point, Craig was talking about something, and Sam turned to me and smiled. It was a movie smile in slow motion, and then everything was okay.  
 When we were all getting ready to leave, I walked up to my grandfather and gave him a hug and kiss on the cheek. He wiped my lip print off with his palm and gave me a look. He doesn't like the boys in the family to touch him. But I'm very glad that I did it anyway in case he dies. I never got to do that with my Aunt Helen.  
 I guess when you see somebody in the hallway or on the field or something, it's nice to know that they are a real person.  
 Do you enjoy holidays with your family? I don't mean your mom and dad family, but your uncle and aunt and cousin family? Personally, I do. There are several reasons for this. First, I am very interested and fascinated by how everyone loves each other, but no one really likes each other. Second, the fights are always the same.  
 It's too bad you're not gay. Then again, if you were gay, I would never date you. You're a mess."You know, Patrick? If I were gay, I'd want to date you."Of course.  
 I think on my next birthday, I'm going to buy her a present. I think that should be the tradition. The kid gets gifts from everybody, and he buys one present for his mom since she was there, too. I think that would be nice.  
 And she looked at me like she couldn't believe I knew she loved Anne Rice. I guess he didn't know how much she talked or how much I listened.  
 Sam dropped me off. When she was too far away to see me, I started to cry again. Because she was my friend again. And that was enough for me.  
 Because the song was that great and because we all really paid attention to it. Five minutes of a lifetime were truly spent, and we felt young in a good way.  
 We Are All Infinite  
 There are other people who have it a lot worse  
 I think they were afraid that some of us would try to kill ourselves or something because they looked very tense and one of them kept touching his beard.  
 The sound of the radio fades to nothing because the waves just can't reach  
 Aceptamos el amor que creemos merecer.  
 So, if this does end up being my last letter, please believe that things are good with me, and even when they're not, they will be soon enough.And I will believe the same about you.  
 And she kissed me. It was the kind of kiss that I could never tell my friends about out loud. It was the kind of kiss that made me know that I was never so happy in my whole life.  
 I just listened to the music, and breathed in the day, and remembered things. Things like walking around the neighborhood and looking at the houses and the lawns and the colorful trees and having that be enough.  
 ...was very fun to be around. She liked movies, and her brother Frank made her tapes of this great music that she shared with us. But over the summer she had her braces taken off, and she got a little taller and prettier and grew breasts. Now, she acts a lot dumber in the hallways, especially when boys are around. And I think it's sad because Susan doesn't look as happy.  
 After a few minutes, it was time for me to leave. I don't know who decides these things. It just happens.  
 I just wish that God or my parents or Sam or my sister or someone would just tell me what's wrong with me. Just tell me how to be different in a way that makes sense. To make this all go away. And disappear. I know that's wrong because it's my responsibility, and I know that things get worse before they get better because that's what my psychiatrist says, but this is a worse that feels too big.  
 Maybe it's good to put things in perspective, but sometimes, I think that the only perspective is to really be there. Because it's okay to feel things. And be who you are about them.  
 I couldn't believe Sam actually got me a present because i honestly thought the "I love you" was it.  
 I spent all night working on it, and I hope Patrick likes it as much as I do. Especially the second side. I hope it's the kind of second side that he can listen to whenever he drives alone and feel like he belongs to something whenever he's sad. I hope it can be that for him.  
 And then Patrick started running after the sunset. And Sam immediately followed him. And I saw them in silhouette. Running after the sun. Then, I started running.And everything was as good as it could be.  
 The radio comes back even louder than you remember it.  
 Every time I see this one particular movie star on a magazine, I can't help but feel terribly sorry for her because nobody respects her at all, and yet they keep interviewing her. And the interviews are all the same thing.They start with what food they are eating in some restaurant. "As _____ gingerly munched her Chinese Chicken Salad, she spoke of love." And all the covers say the same thing: "_____ gets to the bottom of stardom, love, and his/her hit new movie/television show/album."I think it's nice for stars to do interviews to make us think they are just like us, but to tell you the truth, I get the feeling that it's all a big lie. The problem is I don't know who's lying.  
 It's like looking at all the students and wondering who's had their heart broken that day, and how they are able to cope with having three quizzes and a book report on top of that. Or wondering who did the heart breaking. And wondering why. Especially since I know that if they went to another school, the person who had their heart broken would have had their heart broken by somebody else, so why does it have to be so personal?  
 It is important to say "sir" at these moments. And if they ever call you by your first-middle-last name, you better watch out. I'm telling you.  
 PodrÃ­a morir por ti. Pero no voy a vivir para ti.  
 Do you know what 'masturbation' is? I think you probably do because you are older than me. But just in case, I will tell you. Masturbation is when you rub your genitals until you have an orgasm. Wow!  
 I think that if I ever have kids, and they are upset, I won't tell them that people are starving in China or anything like that because it won't change the fact that they are upset.  
 But because thing change. And friends leave. And life doesn't stop for anybody.  
 It's much easier not to know things sometimes.  
 It's just hard to see a friend hurt this much. Especially when you can't do anything except "be there". I want to make him stop hurting, but I can't.  
 in the last month or so, i have read the great gatsby and a separate peace. i am starting to see a real trend in the kind of books bill gives me to read. and just like the tape of songs, it is amazing to hold each of them in the palm of my hand. they are all my favorites. all of them.  
 There's something about that tunnel that leads to downtown. It's glorious at night. Just glorious. You start on one side of the mountain, and it's dark, and the radio is loud. As you enter the tunnel, the wind gets sucked away, and you squint from the lights overhead. When you adjust to the lights, you can see the other side in the distance just as the sound of the radio fades to nothing because the waves just can't reach. Then, you're in the middle of the tunnel, and everything becomes a calm dream. As you see the opening get closer, you just can't get there fast enough. And finally, just when you think you'll never get there, you see the opening right in front of you. And the radio comes back even louder than you remember it. And the wind is waiting. And you fly out of the tunnel onto the bridge. And there it is. The city. A million lights and buildings and everything seems as exciting as the first time you saw it. It really is a grand entrance.  
 I don't think we should base so much on weight, muscles, and a good hair day, but when it happens, it's nice. It really is.  
 To kill a mockingbird. If you haven't read it, I think you should because it is very interesting.  
 Sam sat down and started laughing. Patrick started laughing. I started laughing. And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.  
 This one moment when you know you're not a sad story. You are alive, and you stand up and see the lights on the buildings and everything that makes you wonder. And you're listening to that song and that drive with the people you love most in this world. And in this moment I swear, we are infinite.  
 I want to make sure that the first person you kiss loves you.  
 If somebody likes me, I want them to like the real me, not what they think I am.  
 I mean it's not like in the movies where girls like assholes or anything like that. It's not that easy. They just like somebody that can give them a purpose.  
 I wish I knew. It might make me miss him more clearly. It might have made sad sense.  
 And she says she wants to expose me to all these great things. And to tell you the truth, I don't really want to be exposed to all these great things if it means that I'll have to hear Mary Elizabeth talk about all the great things she exposed me to all the time. I don't understand that. I would give someone a record so they could love the record, not so they would always know that I gave it to them.  
 Patrick started driving really fast, and just before we got to the tunnel. Sam stood up, and the wind turned her dress into ocean waves. When we hit the tunnel, all the sound got scooped up into a vacuum, and it was replaced by a song on the tape player. A beautiful song called âLandslide.â When we got out of the tunnel, Sam screamed this really fun scream, and there it was. Downtown. Lights on buildings and everything that makes you wonder. Sam sat down and started laughing. Patrick started laughing. I started laughing.And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.  
 What's the point of using words nobody knows or can say comfortably?  
 The truth is, when it gets really quiet, when the silence gets too loud, i really start to miss everyone.  
 And how different her face looked the first time she really liked a boy who was not on a poster on her wall. And how her face looked when she realized she was in love with that boy.
